# Unit 2 Project: The Decimation

## Overview
The first phase of The Decimation is a mad dash, in which the player must grab what they can from their house and enter a bunker in a set number of moves. The second phase is a resource management simulator set in an apocalyptic wasteland.

## First Ideas:
We started with the thought of avoiding a fighting game, a common project at our coding camp, so we first considered creating an app. We were short on ideas, so we instead began thinking of making a simulation game dealing with politics. This eventually evolved into a resource management game. 

## Inspirations:
The main source of inspiration for The Decimation was the game '60 Seconds!' by Robot Gentleman. Throughout the course of the project, we eventually found ourselves also pulling inspiration from the Fallout series by Bethesda.
