# Unit 2 Project: The Decimation

## What is it?
The first phase of The Decimation is a mad dash, in which the player must grab what they can from their house and enter a bunker in a set number of moves. The second phase is a resource management simulator set in an apocalyptic wasteland.

## First Ideas:
We started with the thought of avoiding a fighting game, so we considered creating an app. None of those ideas were good enough, so we began thinking of making a simulation game, dealing with politics. This eventually evolved into a resource management game. 

## Inspirations:
The main source of inspiration for The Decimation was the game '60 Seconds!' by Robot Gentleman. Throughout the course of the project, we eventually found ourselves also pulling inspiration from the Fallout series by Bethesda.

## Conclusion:
Are we satisfied?
- We are both satisfied with the outcome, but with any project, we would have liked to add more features if no time constraints existed.

## Possible Additions:
- A timer at the beginning, instead of a set number of moves
- Sirens during the mad dash
- A harder difficulty, where the player is tasked with maintaining multiple survivors
- More encounters
- More locations
